Purpose: The data backend is just read in through a text file by java and then each product becomes instantiated into an instance of our single-entity class and then finally that single entity class product is added to our ProductCollection class which is the entire inventory of the store at this particular time. The ProductCollection class use many different built in features to manage what happens to the inventory and how it is managed. The GUI interface implements many of
the features provided by the data backend and uses Java Swing Components to allow a user a visual represntation of how the inventory many be managed. 

The user is able to see many important visual representations of the inventory status such as:
-Current Inventory
-List of Inventory
-Whether the Inventory is Full 
-The ability to modify the inventory

The intention of the GUI is to allow a user on a local device to make changes to their inventory locally.  This could be used in a small
store where the data was managed by a single person and they just wanted to keep track of their current inventory without it getting too complicated.  
It was not meant to be anything that could be run on a web server, that is why I've decided to make a web application version of this using CSS and HTML.
Expect to see it soon :)
